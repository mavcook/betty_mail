# betty_mail

A quick and dirty script to spam everyone on betty's wall of shame.

Shame: https://chezbetty.eecs.umich.edu/shame

You'll need Drew's mailmerge: https://github.com/awdeorio/mailmerge

After you clone, just type
```bash
./run.sh
```

If evertying looks good, edit run.sh to have --no-dry-run, and run again. Your emails should be sending!
